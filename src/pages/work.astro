                <h3>Why Matomo?</h3>
                <p>
                  While the industry scrambles with privacy regulations and platform changes, <strong>Matomo offers stability, control, and respect for user privacy</strong>. I've guided dozens of organizations through successful migrations from Universal Analytics and GA4 to Matomo, often improving their data quality and reducing compliance headaches simultaneously.
                </p>

                <h3>My Matomo Approach</h3>
                <div class="approach-grid">
                  <div class="approach-item">
                    <h4>Clean Event Architecture</h4>
                    <p>I design event taxonomies that are both comprehensive and maintainable. No more "misc_click_button_maybe" events ‚Äî every interaction is purposefully categorized and documented.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="approach-item">
                    <h4>Tag Manager Implementation</h4>
                    <p>Matomo Tag Manager isn't as mature as GTM, but it's powerful enough for most use cases and keeps your data on your servers. I build tag architectures that are easy to maintain and extend.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="approach-item">
                    <h4>Custom Dimensions Strategy</h4>
                    <p>Matomo's custom dimensions are incredibly flexible. I help organizations design dimension schemas that capture business-specific context without creating analysis paralysis.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="approach-item">
                    <h4>API Integration</h4>
                    <p>Matomo's APIs are robust and well-documented. I build custom dashboards, automated reports, and data exports that integrate seamlessly with existing business systems.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Migration & Data Quality</h3>
                <p>
                  Moving from GA4 to Matomo isn't just a platform switch ‚Äî it's an opportunity to clean up years of accumulated tracking debt. I help organizations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Audit existing tracking</strong> to identify what's actually being used vs. collected</li>
                  <li><strong>Redesign event structures</strong> that align with current business questions</li>
                  <li><strong>Implement data validation</strong> to catch tracking issues before they corrupt reports</li>
                  <li><strong>Create historical data bridges</strong> to maintain year-over-year comparisons</li>
                  <li><strong>Train teams</strong> on new interfaces and capabilities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Consent & Privacy Integration</h3>
                <p>
                  Matomo's privacy features aren't just compliance checkboxes ‚Äî they're designed to provide meaningful insights while respecting user choices. I implement consent management that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Gracefully handles users who opt out without breaking analytics</li>
                  <li>Provides valuable insights from first-party data even with limited tracking</li>
                  <li>Balances user privacy with business intelligence needs</li>
                  <li>Meets GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

                <h2>üîç SEO, AEO & GEO</h2>
                <p class="focus-subtitle">Optimizing for how people actually search today</p>

                <h3>Beyond Traditional SEO</h3>
                <p>
                  Search has fundamentally changed. AI overviews, voice search, and answer engines mean that <strong>traditional keyword optimization is just the baseline</strong>. My approach focuses on three interconnected areas:
                </p>

                <div class="seo-pillars">
                  <div class="pillar">
                    <h4>üîç Traditional SEO</h4>
                    <p>The fundamentals still matter: technical optimization, content structure, internal linking, and page speed. But these are table stakes, not differentiators.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="pillar">
                    <h4>üí° Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)</h4>
                    <p>Optimizing for featured snippets, "People Also Ask" boxes, and direct answer formats that search engines increasingly favor.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="pillar">
                    <h4>ü§ñ Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</h4>
                    <p>Preparing content for AI-powered search tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT search, and Google's AI overviews.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Structured Data Mastery</h3>
                <p>
                  Schema.org markup isn't optional anymore ‚Äî it's how search engines understand your content. I implement comprehensive structured data strategies that include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Entity optimization</strong> ‚Äî helping search engines understand what your business actually does</li>
                  <li><strong>Content relationships</strong> ‚Äî connecting related pieces of content through proper markup</li>
                  <li><strong>Rich results targeting</strong> ‚Äî optimizing for specific SERP features relevant to your industry</li>
                  <li><strong>Knowledge graph integration</strong> ‚Äî building entity authority that helps with broader search visibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical SEO Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                  Modern SEO requires solid technical foundations. I audit and optimize:
                </p>
                <div class="technical-areas">
                  <div class="tech-area">
                    <h4>Performance Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Core Web Vitals aren't just ranking factors ‚Äî they impact user experience and conversion rates. I optimize for real-world performance, not just test scores.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="tech-area">
                    <h4>Crawl Budget Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Large sites need smart crawl management. I help search engines find and index your most important content efficiently.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="tech-area">
                    <h4>International SEO</h4>
                    <p>Proper hreflang implementation, content localization strategies, and technical infrastructure for multi-language sites.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="tech-area">
                    <h4>Mobile-First Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Going beyond responsive design to create mobile experiences that search engines and users love.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Content Strategy for AI Search</h3>
                <p>
                  AI-powered search tools evaluate content differently than traditional search engines. I help organizations adapt their content strategy to perform well in this new landscape:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Comprehensive coverage</strong> ‚Äî creating content that answers the full spectrum of user questions</li>
                  <li><strong>Authoritative sourcing</strong> ‚Äî building content that AI tools want to cite and reference</li>
                  <li><strong>Clear information hierarchy</strong> ‚Äî structuring content so AI can extract key information accurately</li>
                  <li><strong>Context building</strong> ‚Äî connecting individual pieces of content into comprehensive topic coverage</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

              <div class="focus-header">
                <h2>üî¨ Experimentation & Optimization</h2>
                <p class="focus-subtitle">Rigorous testing that drives real business impact</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="focus-content">
                <h3>The Experimentation Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  Most A/B testing is broken. Teams run tests without proper statistical foundations, declare victory on insignificant results, and optimize for metrics that don't drive business outcomes. <strong>I help build experimentation programs that actually work</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>My Testing Philosophy</h3>
                <div class="philosophy-points">
                  <div class="philosophy-point">
                    <h4>üìä Statistical Rigor First</h4>
                    <p>Every test starts with proper power analysis, meaningful effect size calculations, and clear success criteria. No "let's see what happens" experiments.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="philosophy-point">
                    <h4>üéØ Business Impact Focus</h4>
                    <p>Optimizing click-through rates is useless if it doesn't improve revenue or user satisfaction. I help teams identify metrics that actually matter to business outcomes.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="philosophy-point">
                    <h4>‚öñÔ∏è Guardrail Metrics</h4>
                    <p>Every test includes guardrail metrics to ensure improvements in primary metrics don't come at the cost of overall user experience or long-term value.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="philosophy-point">
                    <h4>üîÑ Learning Over Winning</h4>
                    <p>Failed tests that generate clear insights are more valuable than winning tests that don't teach us anything. I design experiments that generate learning regardless of outcome.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Platform Expertise</h3>
                <p>I'm certified in both <strong>Optimizely</strong> and <strong>VWO</strong>, but more importantly, I understand when to use each platform and when to build custom solutions:</p>

                  <div class="platform">

                </div>

                <h3>Experiment Design & Methodology</h3>
                <p>Great experiments start with great hypotheses. I help teams move beyond "what if we make this button blue?" to structured hypothesis formation:</p>

                  <div class="step">

                <h3>Building Experimentation Culture</h3>
                <p>Technology is the easy part ‚Äî the hard part is building organizational capabilities for continuous experimentation. I help teams:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Create experiment backlogs</strong> that prioritize high-impact, high-learning opportunities</li>

                <div class="tech-stack">
                  <div class="tech-category">
                    <h4>Data Warehousing</h4>
                    <p><strong>BigQuery</strong> for most use cases ‚Äî it's cost-effective, scales automatically, and integrates well with analytics tools. I also work with PostgreSQL for smaller datasets and Snowflake for enterprise requirements.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="tech-category">
                    <h4>Data Processing</h4>
                    <p><strong>Python</strong> for most data transformation work, with pandas for data manipulation and Apache Airflow for complex workflow orchestration. Simple pipelines might just use BigQuery SQL.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="tech-category">
